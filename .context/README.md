# Context Directory - Secret Garden Circles App UI Modernization

This directory contains the context/memory bank for the Secret Garden Circles app UI modernization project. The context system helps maintain project knowledge and continuity across development sessions.

## Purpose

The Secret Garden Circles app is being modernized to match new design specifications while leveraging the existing DaisyUI/Tailwind CSS foundation. This context directory tracks our progress, decisions, and implementation details.

## File Structure

### Core Files
- `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document defining the modernization scope and goals
- `productContext.md` - Why we're modernizing and what problems we're solving
- `activeContext.md` - Current work focus and immediate next steps
- `systemPatterns.md` - UI architecture, component patterns, and design decisions
- `techContext.md` - Technologies, constraints, and development setup
- `progress.md` - Implementation status and completed work

## How to Use

1. **Start each session** by reading the core files to understand current state
2. **Update activeContext.md** when switching focus areas
3. **Update progress.md** after completing significant work
4. **Update systemPatterns.md** when making architectural decisions
5. **Keep files current** to maintain project continuity

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Modernize the Secret Garden Circles app UI to match new design specifications
**Approach**: Iterative enhancement using existing DaisyUI/Tailwind foundation
**Focus**: Clean, modern interface with improved UX and visual design
